## how to use

in the index.html, replace all the blocks by the ones you want
  
``` html
<div class='audio-container'  name='Example with existing sources'>
  <audio name="fisrt source" url="./data/sample.ogg"></audio>
  <audio name="second source" url="./data/sample.ogg"></audio>
  <audio name="third source" url="./data/sample.ogg"></audio>
</div>
```   

* each block must have the class `audio-container` and a `name` attribute like shown above.
* audio track must have a `name` attribute and an `url` attribute (not src !) 
* all the audio tracks must be in the same domain than your webpage.
* If you want not to preload audio files, add the preload="none" to you audio-container div, exemple : 

``` html
<div class='audio-container'  name='Example with existing sources' preload="none">
  <audio name="fisrt source" url="./data/sample.ogg"></audio>
  <audio name="second source" url="./data/sample.ogg"></audio>
  <audio name="third source" url="./data/sample.ogg"></audio>
</div>
``` 

If you do not want to mix the tracks there is nomute switch which allows you to only hear one track at a time (basically soloing each track)

``` html
<div class='audio-container nomute'  name='Example with existing sources'>
  <audio name="fisrt source" url="./data/sample.ogg"></audio>
  <audio name="second source" url="./data/sample.ogg"></audio>
  <audio name="third source" url="./data/sample.ogg"></audio>
</div>
``` 

And that's all. This seems more stable Under Firefox and Google Chrome. Safari has some problems when playback many tracks as there seems to be a delay for each track. However this is not a problem when you don't want to playback any files simultanously but just soloing each of the tracks one by one (*nomute* class).
